# Simple Dice Roller
This is a simple dice roller made in C#. If you just wanna use the program download it from the relases tab. Just download the .exe file and open it.

If, however you want to download the source code to work on it yourself just clone the repository and open the solution file (.sln) with visual studio/your editor of choice.
